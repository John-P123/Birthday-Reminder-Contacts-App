# Birthday-Reminder
A personal project. Desktop app built in Java using the db4o open-source database

The purpose of this app is to remind users when the birthdays of family and friends are approaching. This program implements Actian's "embeddable open source object database for Java and .NET developers."

Currently looking for contributors to help build specific functions. See Issues tab for more info.
