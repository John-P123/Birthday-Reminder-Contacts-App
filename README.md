A personal project. Desktop app built in Java using the db4o open-source database. 

## Details
The purpose of this app is to remind users when birthdays of family and friends are approaching. This program implements Actian's "embeddable open source object database for Java and .NET developers." Planning to expand functionality after building basic mobile app for ANDROID (takes advantage of notifications and other platform-dependent functions). 

## Contributing
- Seeking help to build certain functions. A small team would be great!
- When editing program, make sure to change the path of the file in Main.java to a text file you create on your computer. Data is hosted locally!


## Installing Db4o
- [Download](https://www.dropbox.com/s/s6farl3dqez7e1r/db4o-8.0.276.16149-java.zip?dl=0) db4o 
- Learn basics of db4o and how to install with [the db4objects tutorial](http://www-users.mat.umk.pl/~stencel/obd/db4o-7.8-tutorial.pdf).

## Future Plan
- After fundamentals/basics of this project are built, we're planning on developing it into an application with smart features
- More info coming soon!
